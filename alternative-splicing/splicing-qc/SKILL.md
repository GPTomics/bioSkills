## Version Compatibility

Reference examples tested with: matplotlib 3.8+, pandas 2.2+, pysam 0.22+

Before using code patterns, verify installed versions match. If versions differ:
- Python: `pip show <package>` then `help(module.function)` to check signatures
- CLI: `<tool> --version` then `<tool> --help` to confirm flags

If code throws ImportError, AttributeError, or TypeError, introspect the installed
package and adapt the example to match the actual API rather than retrying.

# Splicing Quality Control

Assess RNA-seq data quality specifically for alternative splicing analysis.

## Junction Saturation Analysis

**Goal:** Determine whether sequencing depth is sufficient for comprehensive splicing detection.

**Approach:** Run RSeQC junction saturation on BAM files and check whether the junction discovery curve reaches a plateau.

**"Assess RNA-seq quality for splicing analysis"** -> Evaluate junction saturation, junction novelty rate, splice site strength, and read coverage.
- Python/CLI: `junction_saturation.py`, `junction_annotation.py` (RSeQC)
- Python: maxentpy for splice site scoring, pysam for junction read counting

```bash
# RSeQC junction saturation (check sequencing depth)
# Note: -s flag removed in RSeQC v3.0
junction_saturation.py \
    -i sample.bam \
    -r annotation.bed \
    -o sample_junc_sat
```

```python
import subprocess
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Run junction saturation for multiple samples
samples = ['sample1.bam', 'sample2.bam', 'sample3.bam']

for sample in samples:
    subprocess.run([
        'junction_saturation.py',
        '-i', sample,
        '-r', 'annotation.bed',
        '-o', sample.replace('.bam', '_junc_sat')
    ], check=True)

# Parse results and check for plateau
# Plateau indicates sufficient depth for splicing analysis
# If curves still rising, may need more sequencing depth
```

## Junction Annotation

**Goal:** Classify observed junctions as known, partially novel, or completely novel relative to annotation.

**Approach:** Run RSeQC junction annotation and compute the ratio of known to novel junctions as a data quality indicator.

```bash
# Classify junctions as known, partial novel, or complete novel
junction_annotation.py \
    -i sample.bam \
    -r annotation.bed \
    -o sample_junc_annot
```

```python
import pandas as pd

# Analyze junction annotation results
junc_stats = pd.read_csv('sample_junc_annot.junction.xls', sep='\t')

# Calculate junction type proportions
total = junc_stats['total_splicing_events'].sum()
known = junc_stats[junc_stats['annotation'] == 'known']['total_splicing_events'].sum()
novel = total - known

print(f'Known junctions: {known/total:.1%}')
print(f'Novel junctions: {novel/total:.1%}')

# High novel junction rate may indicate:
# - Incomplete annotation
# - Mapping artifacts
# - Interesting biology (cancer, tissue-specific)
```

## Splice Site Strength Scoring

**Goal:** Score donor and acceptor splice sites to identify weak or cryptic splice sites.

**Approach:** Use MaxEntScan (via maxentpy) to compute information-theoretic scores for 5' and 3' splice site sequences.

```python
# MaxEntScan scoring via maxentpy
# 5'ss (donor): typical score 8-10 bits
# 3'ss (acceptor): typical score 8-12 bits

from maxentpy import maxent
from maxentpy.maxent import score5, score3

# Score 5' splice site (9bp: 3 exon + 6 intron)
donor_seq = 'CAGGTAAGT'  # Consensus: CAG|GTAAGT
score_5ss = score5(donor_seq)
print(f"5'ss score: {score_5ss:.2f}")

# Score 3' splice site (23bp: 20 intron + 3 exon)
acceptor_seq = 'TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCAG'
score_3ss = score3(acceptor_seq)
print(f"3'ss score: {score_3ss:.2f}")

# Weak splice sites (score < 5) may indicate:
# - Alternative/cryptic splice sites
# - Annotation errors
# - Regulatory splice sites
```

## Junction Read Coverage

**Goal:** Profile the distribution of junction-spanning read counts across all splice sites in a BAM file.

**Approach:** Parse CIGAR strings for N operations (splice junctions) using pysam and tally reads per junction.

```python
import pysam
import pandas as pd

def count_junction_reads(bam_path, min_overhang=8):
    '''Count junction-spanning reads per splice site.'''
    bam = pysam.AlignmentFile(bam_path, 'rb')
    junction_counts = {}

    for read in bam.fetch():
        if read.is_unmapped:
            continue

        # Check CIGAR for splice junctions (N operation)
        ref_pos = read.reference_start
        for op, length in read.cigartuples:
            if op == 3:  # N = splice junction
                junction = (read.reference_name, ref_pos, ref_pos + length)
                junction_counts[junction] = junction_counts.get(junction, 0) + 1
            if op in [0, 2, 3]:  # M, D, N consume reference
                ref_pos += length

    bam.close()
    return junction_counts

# Analyze coverage distribution
junctions = count_junction_reads('sample.bam')
counts = list(junctions.values())

print(f'Total junctions: {len(junctions)}')
print(f'Junctions >= 10 reads: {sum(1 for c in counts if c >= 10)}')
print(f'Junctions >= 20 reads: {sum(1 for c in counts if c >= 20)}')
```

## Quality Thresholds

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| Junction saturation | Plateau reached | Near plateau | Still rising |
| Known junctions | > 80% | > 60% | < 60% |
| Junctions >= 10 reads | > 50% | > 30% | < 30% |
| 5'ss score | > 8 | > 5 | < 5 |
| 3'ss score | > 8 | > 5 | < 5 |

## Troubleshooting Low Detection

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Few junctions | Low depth, short reads | More sequencing, longer reads |
| Low saturation | Insufficient depth | Increase sequencing |
| Many novel junctions | Annotation gaps | Update annotation, check organism |
| Weak splice sites | Cryptic splicing | Validate experimentally |
